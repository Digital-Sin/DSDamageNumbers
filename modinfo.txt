= How to Modify ===============================================

	Replacing Font:
		* Swap the sprites of the existing numbers to the
		  new ones.
		* Ensure the sprite names are exactly the same and
		  offsets are set to (0,0) for proper alignment
		* If done correctly, the font should be
		  displayed correctly!
	Adding Fonts:
		* Add the number sprites to the "sprites" folder
		  ( preferrably in a subfolder )
		* Ensure the sprite offsets are set to (0,0) for
		  proper alignment
		* Ensure the sprite naming convention is correct
		    ####N0:
			  * #### = Sprite name
			  * N = Frame number ( A-J = 0-9 )
			  * 0 = Rotation ( Keep as 0 )
		* Sprites must be loaded into data in some way,
		  so open "scripts/class_damnum.zs" and add the
		  sprite name to the "List" section. ( #### A -1; )
		* Open "menudef.lmp" and add the sprite name to the
		  "DamNumFont" OptionString section followed by it's
		  name. ( "####", "Font Name" )
		* If all steps are done correctly, your
		  new font should be selectable in the settings!
	Adding Font Colors:
		* In "trnslate.lmp", add your desired color name
		  followed by it's value like so:
		    Color = "0:255=%[0,0,0]:[R.RR, G.GG, B.BB]"
		    ( RGB values are 0.00 - 1.00 )
		* In "menudef.lmp", add your color name to the
		  "DamNumColor" OptionString section. ( "Name", "Name" )
